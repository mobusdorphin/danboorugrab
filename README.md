# danboorugrab

Automatically downloads all pictures with certain tag from danbooru.donmai.us specified by command line args.  Tags can be separated by + or by space.  

First amasses list of URLs of pictures containing all tags given.  Then gives the option to list all URLs (and if so if user wishes to save that list) before asking whether to go ahead and download. 

Depends on requests and wget python modules (available through pip)
